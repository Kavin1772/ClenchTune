## 🔍 Objective
Build a hands-free music player using EMG signals and Arduino, controlled via palm muscle clenching.

---

## 💡 Features
- Pause/Play using left palm clench (A0)
- Skip track using right palm clench (A1)
- Real-time signal filtering
- Python + Arduino integration

---

## 🔧 How It Works
1. EMG signals are read via analog pins (A0, A1)
2. Arduino sends serial data to Python
3. Python filters and interprets the signal
4. Triggers playback using Pygame
