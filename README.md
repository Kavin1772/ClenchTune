# ClenchTune

This project presents a hands-free music control system that leverages Electromyography (EMG) signals to enable intuitive human-computer interaction. By capturing muscle activity from the user's forearms using EMG sensors, the system maps specific clenching gestures to playback commands such as play/pause and track skipping. Implemented with Arduino and Python, this real-time interface exemplifies the use of biosignals in media control and highlights the promise of EMG technology in assistive and immersive systems.
